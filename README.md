# Angular-Blog

This is a blogging platform built with Angular.Js as well as AngularFire and
Firebase

The comment system works however the ability to delete said comments is not
possible at the moment however I am currently working on it

In order to create a post naviagte to the admin.html doc and before clicking
publish you mush paste a link to an image url. Uploading files to the firebase
server is something I did not choose to do as it would possibly slow down the
load time of the site as well as eat up my firebase account space

#Note as this was built with Firebase any comments or posts created by anybody
#will be pushed to anyone viewing the application
